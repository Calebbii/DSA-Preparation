## Background

This repo is intended for any individual wanting to improve their problem
solving skills for software engineering interviews.

Problems are grouped under their respective subtopic, in order to focus on
repeatedly applying common patterns rather than randomly tackling questions.

All questions are available on [leetcode.com] with some requiring [leetcode premium].

## Fundamentals

To find the greatest amount of success when practicing, it is highly recommended
to know the methods and runtimes of the following data structures and their
operations:

- Arrays
- Maps
- Linked Lists
- Queues
- Heaps
- Stacks
- Trees
- Graphs

In addition, you should have a good grasp on common algorithms such as:

- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
- Binary search
- Recursion


## Solutions

Solutions written in Javascript and Python can be found in the [solutions] branch.

## Suggestions

Think a question should/shouldn't be included? Wish there was another feature?
Feel free to open an [issue] with your suggestion!
